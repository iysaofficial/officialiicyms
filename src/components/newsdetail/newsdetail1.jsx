                    Sulthan Fathi Nur Alauddin (FST), Ardelia Bertha Prastika
                    (FK), Syadilla Rahmansyah (FKM), Intan Fairuz Zakia (FK),
                    and Bernika Citra Dwi Prasetya (FISIP), again made
                    achievements in the international arena. The students, who
                    come from various departments and batches, won a silver
                    medal for the social life category in the International
                    Invention Competition For Young Moslem Scientists (IICYMS)
                    2022. The competition was held from May 21 to June 14, 2022
                    at UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung, West Java. In an
                    interview with UNAIR NEWS, Sulthan Fathi Nur Alauddin as the
                    team leader said that they got the idea to make Nuqof: Halal
                    Water Treatment Tool with Ocimum Sanctum L Based on
                    Crowdfunding Waqf as an Effort to Empower Drought Affected
                    Communities to Support SDGs 2030. Waqf that has not been
                    well optimized in Indonesia is the background for Nuqof to
                    develop a drinking water treatment tool that, Insha Allah,
                    is based on waqf," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The idea is to provide clean water to the community in need
                    through a waqf system. A filtration concept that combines
                    water filtration from ceramic, basil, and natural zeolite
                    stones will be implemented in the Nuqof system. "In this
                    way, the waqf culture in Indonesia is not only reserved for
                    mosques and Islamic boarding schools, but also for other
                    humanitarian and other humanitarian, humanitarian matters,
                    such as the provision of clean water," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sulthan hopes Nuqof can solve the water problem problem and
                    provide water supply in drought-stricken areas of drought
                    areas in Indonesia to minimize the scarcity of clean water
                    and water and minimize the scarcity of clean water and
                    drinking water. drinking water. "Hopefully there will be no
                    more drought in Indonesia, especially in drought areas in
                    Indonesia, especially in areas where the water is not
                    suitable for drinking, consumption and use," he said. drink,
                    consume, and use," he said. he said. Writer: Ananda Wildhan
